# DIRAM Boolean Logic Truth Table - Memory Management Gates

## OBINexus Aegis Project | Directed Instruction RAM

#### Governance Constraint : ε(x) ≤ 0.5 | Binary Logic : 2-Input, 1-Output

## ⚙ Logic Gate Truth Table Breakdown

#### Here we're looking at how binary inputs transform into actionable output using gates like NOT and XOR:

```
 
```
```
Input A Input B NOT A A XOR B Final Output
```
##### 0 0 1 0 1

##### 0 1 1 1 0

##### 1 0 0 1 1

##### 1 1 0 0 0

## 🧠 Memory Management + Binary State

#### Input Definitions:

#### Input A : Cache State (0 = Cache Miss, 1 = Cache Hit)

#### Input B : Governance State (0 = ε≤0.5 Compliant, 1 = ε>0.5 Violation)

#### Final Output : Memory Action (0 = Block/Defer, 1 = Allow/Process)

## Truth Table Logic Explanation:

#### Row 1: A=0, B=0 → Cache Miss + Compliant

#### NOT A = 1 (miss requires action)

#### XOR = 0 (both inputs low)

#### Output = 1 ✅ Allow : Cache miss with good governance → Fetch data, update cache

#### Row 2: A=0, B=1 → Cache Miss + Violation

#### NOT A = 1 (miss requires action)

#### XOR = 1 (inputs differ)

#### Output = 0 ❌ Block : Cache miss during constraint violation → Defer allocation

#### Row 3: A=1, B=0 → Cache Hit + Compliant

#### NOT A = 0 (hit needs no extra action)

#### XOR = 1 (inputs differ)


#### Output = 1 ✅ Allow : Cache hit with good governance → Process immediately

#### Row 4: A=1, B=1 → Cache Hit + Violation

#### NOT A = 0 (hit needs no extra action)

#### XOR = 0 (both inputs high)

#### Output = 0 ❌ Block : Even cache hits blocked during severe violations

## 🔁 Cache Hits vs Misses (Lookahead Memory Logic)

#### When your system needs data, it looks in cache first (like a quick-access drawer). Two things can happen:

### Cache Hit 🟢

#### The needed data is already there—no extra fetch needed. System stays fast.

#### Example : Permitted data is preloaded and the signal finds it instantly

#### Triggers Update : Memory confirms access, adjusts state, nudges related predictions

#### LRU/MRU Action : Promotes accessed item to Most Recently Used

### Cache Miss 🔴

#### The drawer's empty! Now the system must dig deeper (main memory or disk).

#### Data wasn't updated into cache beforehand, so no immediate response

#### Lookup fails , slowing things down until fresh info loads

#### LRU Action : Must evict Least Recently Used item to make space

### Lookahead Hardware Prediction

#### Tries to predict future cache needs—preloading data it suspects the system will ask for. If prediction

#### aligns, more hits happen.

## 🎯 Governance Constraint: ε(x) ≤ 0.

#### Sinphasé Governance Model:

#### Governance States:

// Updated constraint (not 0.6)
```
```
// Updated constraint (not 0.6)
```
##### }}


#### B = 0 : ε ≤ 0.5 → System running within safe memory allocation limits

#### B = 1 : ε > 0.5 → Too many heap events, system must throttle allocations

## 📊 Memory Hardware Address Layout

#### The gates act like checkpoints : deciding when binary info should be stored, passed through, or flipped.

### LRU (Least Recently Used) Logic:

### MRU (Most Recently Used) Logic:

### DIRAM Traceable Cache:

#### Cache hit often aligns with predictable output patterns (like repeated 1s)

#### Cache miss comes from unpredictable or rare signal paths—where XOR flips unexpectedly or NOT

#### cancels out expected inputs

#### SHA-256 receipts generated for every cache operation

#### Lookahead prediction uses confidence scoring to preload likely data

## 🔧 Hardware Implementation

### Cache Layout for New Algorithms:

#### Address tracing : Hardware can see cache layout patterns

#### LRU/MRU transitions : Binary decisions based on access patterns

```
Cache Full? → Need Eviction → Check LRU Chain → Remove Oldest
```
```
Cache Full? → Need Eviction → Check LRU Chain → Remove Oldest
```
```
Cache Hit? → Promote Item → Move to MRU Position → Update Chain
```
```
Cache Hit? → Promote Item → Move to MRU Position → Update Chain

#### Predictive allocation : Uses historical patterns to forecast future needs

#### Governance enforcement : ε(x) ≤ 0.5 constraint checked at hardware level

## 🏗 Memory Evolution: Random → Directed

#### Traditional RAM : Passive storage responding to requests DIRAM : Active memory making intelligent

#### decisions based on:

#### Binary logic gates for fast decision-making

#### Cache hit/miss prediction patterns

#### Governance constraints preventing resource exhaustion

#### Cryptographic traceability for security

#### The truth table shows how 2 simple binary inputs can create sophisticated memory management

#### behavior through careful logic gate design.

#### Result : Memory that doesn't just store—it thinks, predicts, and governs its own allocation patterns

#### using boolean logic as the foundation.
